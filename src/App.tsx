                My girl Penny was only 6 years old. She was taken from us as a
                result of canine lymphoma. We understand the shock and pain of
                this terrible disease. The Facebook community &quot;Fighting
                Canine Lymphoma&quot; offered much comfort when we needed it
                most. Mia Fallon, an aspiring woodworker, wants to memorialize
                Penny&apos;s memory by offering free boxes, so that every
                beloved dog can have a nice resting place. It&apos;s been 1 year
                since our baby passed, but her memory lives on.
